## Demo Narrative: "Maria's Morning" (~10 min)

### Setting

> It's mid-January. Q4 2025 just closed. **Maria** is the reporting actuary at Bricksurance SE. She needs to produce four QRTs and submit them to BaFin by end of month.

---

### Scene 1: Control Tower (1.5 min)

**Open the app** → click **Monitor**

> "First thing every morning during reporting season — have my data feeds arrived?"

**Show:**
- **KPI strip** at the top: feeds received, DQ pass rate, reconciliation checks, quarantined rows
- **Feed status cards**: each data feed with source system name, row count, SLA status
  - Reinsurance arrived 11 days early — "the RI team is always first"
  - Expenses arrived just in time — "finance usually cuts it close"
- **Cross-QRT Reconciliation** at the bottom: total assets match balance sheet, GWP matches premiums, own funds exceed SCR — all MATCH

> "In the old world I'd be sending emails asking 'has your data landed?' Now I open one page."

---

### Scene 2: Data Quality (1 min)

**Click** → **Data Quality** in the nav

> "Before I look at the numbers: how clean is the data?"

**Show:**
- **Overall pass rate**: 99.9% across 14 DLT expectations
- **Trend chart**: quality improving Q1→Q3 (quarantined rows declining)
- **Per-pipeline breakdown**: expand S.06.02 — 4 assets dropped for null IDs
- **Action badges**: `DROP ROW` (quarantined), `FAIL UPDATE` (blocks pipeline), `WARN` (logged)

> "Every expectation is defined in SQL right next to the transformation. An auditor can read it. Bad data doesn't propagate."

---

### Scene 3: DLT Pipeline (1 min)

**Open the S.05.01 DLT pipeline** (link from Quick Links above, or from the workspace)

> "Here's the pipeline graph. Three data streams — premiums, claims, expenses — flow through silver aggregation, merge into the EIOPA template, then produce the summary ratios."

**Click a node** (e.g., `premiums_by_lob`) → show:
- The SQL transformation
- `CONSTRAINT gross_written_positive EXPECT (gross_written_premium > 0) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW`

> "The DQ rules are embedded in the pipeline. If a premium is negative, it's dropped before reaching the QRT."

---

### Scene 4: QRT Reports (2 min)

**Back in the app** → **Reports** → click **S.25.01 — SCR Standard Formula**

**Content tab**: SCR waterfall — market risk, default, non-life, BSCR, op risk, final SCR.

**EIOPA Template tab**: Click it — shows the actual S.25.01 regulatory form with EIOPA row references (R0010-R0200). Click **Download PDF**.

> "This is exactly what BaFin will see."

**Period Comparison tab**: Side-by-side Q1, Q2, Q3.

> "If the regulator asks 'why did SCR change?' — I show them this."

**Reconciliation tab**: Cross-QRT checks — SCR vs own funds, asset counts.

> "Consistency across all four QRTs, checked automatically."

---

### Scene 5: Pipeline Lineage (1 min)

**Still on S.25.01** → click **Lineage** tab

> "The full audit trail. Every step from ingestion to export, with the actual SQL and DQ expectations."

**Show:**
- 4 phases: Ingestion → Transformation → Confirmation → Export
- The **Model** step (step 3) shows: "Standard Formula Champion from Unity Catalog"
- Click **Show SQL** on any step

**Switch to S.05.01 → Lineage** to show the richer DAG:
- 3 parallel ingestion streams (premiums, claims, expenses)
- 3 parallel silver transformations
- Merge into gold EIOPA template

---

### Scene 6: Stochastic Modelling — S.26.06 (1.5 min)

**Back to Reports** → click **S.26.06 — NL Underwriting Risk**

> "This one is different. It has a stochastic modelling step."

**Click Lineage tab** → show the unique pipeline:
- **Preparation phase**: Exposures exported as CSV to a Unity Catalog Volume
- **Stochastic phase**: "Stochastic engine — 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, 7 perils"
- Click **Show SQL** on the engine step — shows the export/import code

> "In production, that CSV goes to whatever stochastic engine you use — Igloo, Remetrica, RMS, Moody's, or your internal model. The results come back. Databricks orchestrates the handoff and imports the stochastic output."

**Content tab**: NL UW risk breakdown — premium risk, reserve risk, cat risk, diversification.

---

### Scene 7: Model Governance (1 min)

**On S.25.01** → click **Model Governance** tab

> "Which version of the model did we use? The question every actuary dreads."

**Show:**
- **Champion** (v1, 2025 calibration): SCR = EUR 549M — this is production
- **Challenger** (v2, 2026 calibration): SCR = EUR 560M — pending for next year
- **Impact analysis**: +2% SCR driven by tighter correlations and higher op risk

> "Both versions are in Unity Catalog with full audit trail. Promoting the Challenger is one alias change."

**Open the Model Registry** (Quick Links) → show v1/v2, Champion alias

---

### Scene 8: Approval + Certificate (1 min)

**On S.25.01** → click **Approve / Export** tab

1. Click **Submit for Review**
2. Add comment: *"Validated against actuarial function report. Property combined ratio spike explained by December fire claim."*
3. Click **Approve & Export to Tagetik**
4. Click **Generate Certificate**

> "A PDF certificate with the approval timestamp, reviewer, and SHA-256 hash of the data. The CSV is exported to the regulatory volume. Ready for XBRL."

---

### Scene 9: Dashboard (30s)

**Click Dashboard** in the nav → **Open Dashboard**

> "The CFO wants a single view. Four tabs: Overview with solvency ratio trend, then drill into each QRT."

Show the 5-tab Lakeview dashboard. Point out the Pipeline & DQ tab.

---

### Scene 10: Ask Genie (30s)

**Click Ask Genie** → **Open Genie**

Type: *"What is the solvency ratio for Q3 2025?"*

> "Two weeks later, the CFO has a question. No SQL skills needed."

---

### Scene 11: AI Actuarial Review (1.5 min) — NEW

**On S.25.01** → **Approve / Export** tab → click **Generate AI Review**

> "Now here's where it gets interesting. Maria used to spend 2-3 hours reviewing each QRT manually. Let's see what the AI agent produces in 15 seconds."

**Show:**
- Progress bar with timer
- Structured review appears: Executive Summary, Key Metrics, Period Analysis, DQ Assessment, Risk Flags, Recommendation
- **Expand the Guardrails banner** — show all checks passed
- **Expand Agent Governance & Security Controls** — 12 controls across 7 layers

> "The AI read the data, compared to last quarter, checked DQ, and wrote this review. Maria reads it in 5 minutes instead of writing it in 3 hours. But notice — the AI says 'Recommend Approve'. It cannot actually approve. Maria still clicks the button."

---

### Scene 12: Stochastic Engine Review (1 min) — NEW

**Navigate to S.26.06** → click **Stochastic Engine** tab

> "S.26.06 has a stochastic modelling step. In production, exposure data goes out to whatever engine you use — Igloo, Remetrica, RMS, Moody's, internal model — and results come back."

Click **Review Stochastic Engine Run**

> "The AI agent validates the full cycle: were the exposures complete? Are the VaR/TVaR results reasonable for this portfolio? Does the cat risk make sense relative to premium and reserve risk?"

---

### Scene 13: DQ Triage Agent (1 min) — NEW

**Click Data Quality** → click **Investigate DQ Issues**

> "4 assets got quarantined for null IDs. In the old world, someone opens a ticket and waits. The AI agent investigates immediately."

**Show the triage output:**
- Root cause hypothesis ("likely custodian migration" or "feed timing issue")
- Remediation steps with owners
- Impact assessment: blocking vs non-blocking

> "10 seconds instead of 2 hours of log analysis."

---

### Scene 14: Cross-QRT Consistency (1 min) — NEW

**Click Monitor** (Control Tower) → scroll down → click **Run Consistency Review**

> "Before we submit the package, do all 4 QRTs make sense together?"

**Show the AI output:**
- Checks: assets vs market risk, GWP vs premium risk, NL UW SCR vs S.25.01
- Actuarial reasonableness commentary
- Verdict: consistent or issues found

> "A senior actuary does this mentally. The agent does it explicitly and documents it."

---

### Scene 15: Regulator Q&A (1 min) — NEW

**Click Regulator Q&A** in the nav

Type: *"Prepare a response to BaFin regarding the property combined ratio spike in Q4"*

> "Two weeks after submission, BaFin has a question. Instead of pulling data, writing a letter, getting it reviewed — the agent drafts a response grounded in actual QRT data."

**Show the response:** formal tone, specific numbers, QRT references, data-backed explanation.

> "4-8 hours of work to 15 seconds. The compliance officer reviews and sends."

---

### Scene 16: Security Framework (30s) — NEW

**Open the `agentic_security_framework` notebook** (or show the Governance panel in the app)

> "The question every CISO asks: 'How do we know the AI won't break anything?' Answer: 12 controls, 7 layers, defence in depth."

**Quick highlights:**
- AI cannot approve, submit, or modify data — architecturally impossible
- Only reads summary tables — never raw policyholder records
- Every call logged with full audit trail
- Forbidden pattern detection blocks overreach
- Human always decides

> "This isn't AI replacing the actuary. It's AI doing the first 3 hours of work so the actuary can focus on the last 5 minutes of judgment."

---

### Closing

> "What you just saw: from data arrival monitoring, through automated pipelines, stochastic modelling, quality gates, model governance, EIOPA template production, to approval and export — all on one platform.
>
> And now, with 5 AI agents: the review that took 3 hours happens in 15 seconds. The regulator letter that took a day happens in a minute. The DQ investigation that took half a day happens immediately.
>
> No Excel. No email chains. No 'which version did we use.' And the AI can never approve — the actuary always decides.
>
> The actuary's day goes from chasing data to actually using their judgment."

## Troubleshooting

**App shows empty data / "?" for metrics:**
The app's service principal needs `USE CATALOG`, `ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA`, and `CAN_USE` on the SQL warehouse. The deploy script grants these automatically, but if you recreated the app, re-run the grant commands.

**Dashboard shows "select fields to visualize":**
The dashboard was created but not published, or `queryLines` have issues. Re-run: `python3 scripts/create_dashboard.py <dashboard_id>`

**Genie says "no tables available":**
Tables must be in `serialized_space.data_sources.tables[].identifier` (sorted alphabetically). The deploy script handles this. Max 30 tables per space.

**S.26.06 pipeline fails:**
The `run_igloo` task needs the `exposures` and `igloo_results` tables to exist (created by `generate_data.py`). Run `bootstrap_archive.py` first.

**Pipeline shows "NOTEBOOK_NOT_FOUND":**
Run `databricks bundle deploy` to sync notebooks to the `.bundle` workspace path. Clear local sync state first: `rm -rf .databricks/bundle/dev/sync-snapshots .databricks/bundle/dev/fileset-snapshots`
