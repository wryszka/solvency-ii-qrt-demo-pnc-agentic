-- MAGIC This is what the actuary checks before approving the QRT:
-- MAGIC - Loss ratio = Net 1_raw_claims incurred / Net earned premium
-- MAGIC - Expense ratio = Total 1_raw_expenses / Net earned premium
-- MAGIC - Combined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratio (should be < 100% for profit)
-- MAGIC - Net vs Gross reconciliation per LoB
